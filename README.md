# **Predicting Diabetes Using Artificial Neural Networks**

By Alireza Khandan

## Introduction

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Project using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes mellitus in individuals based on various health indicators and risk factors. Using a dataset collected from Medical City Hospital and Al-Kindy Teaching Hospital in Iraq, we build and evaluate a neural network model to assist healthcare providers in early diagnosis and management of diabetes.
Project Overview

## This project includes the following key steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load, clean, and preprocess the dataset.
2. **Model Building and Training**: Define and train the neural network model.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using metrics and visualizations.
4. **Model Saving and Loading**: Save the trained model for future use and reload it for predictions.

Key Features
------------

* **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and standardize data.
* **Model Training**: Build and train neural networks with TensorFlow and Keras.
* **Evaluation**: Assess model performance with metrics and visualizations.
* **Model Persistence**: Save and reload the trained model.

Libraries and Tools
-------------------

* **Google Colab**: For running the project in a cloud-based environment.
* **TensorFlow & Keras**: For neural network implementation.
* **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation.
* **Scikit-learn**: For preprocessing and evaluation.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.

How to Use
----------

Everything is ready to use on my Google Colab: 

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qW6D6Fp0OppmyAIib3gppQWsCRmWHmJc?usp=sharing)

you just need to upload the dataset, using the folder icon on the side bar. (You don't need to place it into the data sample folder)



**Option 2:**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   
   * Use the link to clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   
   * Open the directory where the repository is cloned.

3. **Open the project in Google Colab**:
   
   * Upload the Jupyter notebook file to your Google Drive and open it with Google Colab.

4. **Follow the steps in the notebook**:
   
   * Preprocess the data.
   * Build and train the neural network model.
   * Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
   * Save and load the model for future use.
     
     

By following these steps, you will be able to replicate the process of predicting diabetes using neural networks and gain insights into the data and model performance.

## Goals

The primary goal of this project is to build a robust predictive model that can help in the early diagnosis of diabetes, providing valuable insights for healthcare providers and potentially reducing the burden of this chronic condition through timely interventions.
