# Diabetes Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks

This repository contains the code and dataset for a machine learning project aimed at predicting diabetes mellitus in individuals based on various risk factors and health indicators. The data were collected from the Iraqi society, specifically from the laboratory of Medical City Hospital and the Specializes Center for Endocrinology and Diabetes at Al-Kindy Teaching Hospital.



Project Overview
----------------

The objective of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the likelihood of diabetes. The dataset includes medical information and laboratory analysis such as patient number, blood sugar levels, age, gender, creatinine ratio, body mass index (BMI), urea levels, cholesterol, fasting lipid profiles (including total, LDL, VLDL, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol), HBA1C, and diabetes classification.
